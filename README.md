1.What is the difference between Props and State? 
Ans. STATE: State is the local state of the component which cannot be accessed and modified outside of the component.
     PROPS: Props, on the other hand, make components reusable by giving components the ability to receive data from their parent component in the form of props. 
     
 2. Explain the useState API?     
 Ans. The useState() is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components . so basically useState is the ability to encapsulate local state in a functional component.
 
 3. Explain the how map, filter, reduce work?
